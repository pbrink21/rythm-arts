This was a group project for the class COMS 319 at ISU. We decided to make a rhythm game with a space background. The basic game was pretty simple – a colored sphere, drawn on a HTML canvas, will start in the center of the canvas. Then it will (randomly) go out to one of the four sides of the canvas. Your goal was to hit the corresponding key on your keyboard (Up = w, Down = s, Left = a, Right = d) while the sphere was touching the edge. There were also things like difficulty settings (how fast the spheres went), what size the spheres were, etc. You could also buy “power-ups” with in-game points you got from playing. We also had a full auth system and points were linked to your account. 
There are still a few rough edges on this project. I may iron them out at some point, but I've generally had better things to do with my time than that.
